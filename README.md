# Startup-Company-EDA
Exploratory Analysis of Company Financial Metrics

This project was a culmination of both PowerBI and SQL.
- allows startup creators to:
  - see the potential scalability in different types of startups
  - view tradeoffs that come with scalability and chance of profitability.
  
This project calculates the Average Probability of Profitability of Startup Industries, and measures Scalability Using Valuation to Funding Ratios. 

*Columns regrading valuation, funding, and revenue are in the dataset are measured by millions.*

Here is the interactive dashboard I made using PowerBI.

Using the data in this table, we can clearly see that Internet of Things (IoT) industry companies require less funding and have the highest chance of probability. 
However, the valuation of IoT isn't as scalable as some of the other industries! The average valuation of IoT startups are relatively low.

Top 5 monetary valuation startups and whether they are profitable or not, as well as the probability of the industry being profitable. (For example, a 0.56 industry_profit_chance means 56% probability of the startup being profitable).
It seems that E-Commerce seems to be profitable at the top startups ranked by valuation. Cybersecurity, on the other hand, not really. 
In my previous queries, however, I've shown that valuation for cybersecurity companies have on average ~70% more valuation than IoT.

In conclusion, E-Commerce seems to be profitable for startups, but Cybersecurity offers more scalability depending on what the end user's goal is.
